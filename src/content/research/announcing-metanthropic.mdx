summary: "A frontier research institution architecting the physics of AGI. We move beyond probabilistic scaling to engineer deterministic systems where safety and reasoning are verifiable, intrinsic properties of intelligence."

We are founding **Metanthropic** with a singular conviction: the next leap in Artificial General Intelligence will not come from simply adding more data, but from better physics.

Under the leadership of Founder and Director **Ekjot Singh**, we operate on the thesis that current "Black Box" scaling laws have reached a ceiling of interpretability. To build systems that are broadly beneficial, we must move from *probabilistic guessing* to *deterministic reasoning*.

## Our Research Agenda

We are pushing the frontier of deep learning across three integrated pillars, treating them not as separate disciplines, but as a unified architecture:

1. **Post-Transformer Architectures**
   We are moving beyond standard implementations to architect next-generation models designed for high-fidelity scaling. Our research focuses on sub-quadratic attention mechanisms that sustain coherence over infinite contexts.

2. **Native Reasoning (System 2)**
   True intelligence requires more than pattern matching. We are advancing the state of the art in "Native Reasoning"—building systems where multi-step logic and long-horizon planning are inherent to the model's forward pass, not patched on via prompting.

3. **Provable Alignment**
   Safety is not a post-training patch. We integrate mechanistic interpretability directly into the pre-training objective. We do not just want models that *act* safe; we are building models that are mathematically constrained from failure.

## The Path Forward

The development of AGI presents the greatest technical opportunity of our time. But it necessitates an uncompromising commitment to understanding the systems we build. Metanthropic is not just a research lab; it is the infrastructure for the next generation of safe, reasoning minds.

We invite researchers, engineers, and partners to join us in solving the physics of intelligence.
